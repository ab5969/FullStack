These are the steps by which we can create a repo in github using command line (terminal):

Initial commands after creating a repository in github:
git init
ls -a [lists all hidden .git file]
git status [To keep track of all the files]
git add .[To use all the files or replace . with the specific filename ]
git commit -m "first commit" [To commit a message]
git branch -M main [branch selection]
git remote add origin https://github.com/ab5969/FullStack.git (add the link which was there on github after creating the website)
after the above line files from local window will be pushed to github
git push -u origin main

Suppose I created another style1.css file or I made any changes to the existing file and I wish to push it or add the changes to github in my same rep that i created then these steps to follow:
-git status [ it will list style1.css file as untracked]
-git add style1.css or git add . 
-git commit -m "pushing style1.css file"
-git push

//websites to deploy our project: netlify , vercel.com

After modification :
git status 
git add . [or name of the specific file where modification was done]
git commit -m "Modified CSS" [adding a message\\ m:stands for message]
git pull origin main
git push

On gitbash:
$ git config --global user.name "abhinavsiingh" //same as there on github
$ git config --global user.email "as854@snu.edu.in" //same as there on github
$ git config --global --edit [ Vim editor will open and to come out : press esc and write :wq]

To clone a repository:
in the repository which u want to clone click on the dropdown menu bar and copy the URL
in gitbash choose a directory where u wish to clone cd Desktop/
git clone URL(copied from the repo)
cd reponame/
code . [to open in vs code]
